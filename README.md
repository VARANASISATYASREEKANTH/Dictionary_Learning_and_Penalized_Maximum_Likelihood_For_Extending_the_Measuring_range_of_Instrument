# Dictionary_Learning_and_Penalized_Maximum_Likelihood_For_Extending_the_Measuring_range_of_Instrument
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extending the temperature measurement range and sustaining the system performance
are important requirements in Rayleigh lidars. While replacing hardware and increasing
the power aperture product are ways of achieving these objectives, the data analysis approach
is another means for achieving the same. A method to retrieve atmospheric temperatures using
the penalized maximum likelihood method after denoising the backscattered signal using the
dictionary learning technique is presented and compared with the conventional method. The
proposed combination has the advantage of improving the measurement range and reducing
the standard error (SE) in temperatures. The penalized maximum likelihood function is solved
using the method of successive approximations, and the SE in temperature is calculated using
Monte Carlo simulations. Observations from the Rayleigh lidar at the National Atmospheric
Research Laboratory, India, are used for testing the approach. When compared with the conventional
method, the SE in temperatures improved by 5K at 84 km, and the average height improvement
was about 6 km.\\
